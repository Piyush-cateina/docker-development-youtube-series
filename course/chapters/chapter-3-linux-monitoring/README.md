# Chapter 3 : Linux Monitoring

Back to [Course Introduction](../../README.md)

This the previous chapters, we have spent quite a bit of time understanding operating systems and command line and why it's so important.  </br>
Modern cloud and IT tends to hide or abstract a lot of how servers and operating systems function as well as how they are monitored. </br>
This means engineers often lack the knowledge and expertise on how to dismantle a system and monitor it with bare essential command line tools. </br>

In this chapter we'll take a look at monitoring concepts and introduce a few more command line tools that help us monitor our server. </br>
